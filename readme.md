# 🔍 Round-1B: Persona-Driven PDF Intelligence | Adobe India Hackathon 2025

This project is built for **Round-1B** of the Adobe India Hackathon 2025. It transforms a collection of unstructured PDFs into intelligent, persona-focused summaries — highlighting only what matters most based on a user's role and goal.

---

## 🚀 What This Does

- Extracts titles and headings (H1–H4) from multiple PDFs.
- Accepts a **persona** and **job-to-be-done** from a text file (`input.txt`).
- Ranks the most relevant sections across all documents using semantic similarity and keyword overlap.
- Extracts key paragraph-level snippets from the most relevant sections.
- Outputs everything into a single, well-structured JSON file.

## 🧠 Challenge Theme

> **Connect What Matters — For the User Who Matters**

This project reimagines reading by understanding documents **as a machine would** — surfacing insights that matter to a specific user performing a specific task.

## 📥 How to Provide Input

Also, place 3–10 PDF documents into the `pdfs/` directory.

It contains:
- Metadata (documents, persona, job, timestamp)
